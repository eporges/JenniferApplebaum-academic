abstract: "Previous research shows that companion animals can have a positive effect\
  \ on their owner's health and may also serve as a buffer to stress. Despite this,\
  \ few studies have investigated the role of the pet in adverse or tumultuous family\
  \ circumstances. In this study, we explored whether reported family conflict is\
  \ associated with strength of attachment to companion animals. We analyzed a large\
  \ sample of pet-owning primary caregivers of children (n = 1,421) to understand\
  \ how family conflict and pet attachment may be associated. Primary caregivers were\
  \ asked to report the frequency of instances of intrafamily criticism and discussion\
  \ styles, as well as types of interactions with pets in the home to assess strength\
  \ of attachment. Results from bivariate tests of association and ordinary least\
  \ squares regression models indicated that there was a significant association between\
  \ family conflict and strength of attachment to companion animals: as the amount\
  \ of family conflict increased, so did the strength of attachment to the family\
  \ pet. Family conflict remained a significant predictor of strength of pet attachment\
  \ with the inclusion of sociodemographic control variables, which indicated that\
  \ the association was not an indirect result of other correlations. These findings\
  \ suggest that companion animals play an important role in the lives of family members\
  \ who are experiencing adverse situations or chronic strain such as family conflict,\
  \ and they underscore a need for further investigation into the role of the pet\
  \ in the family. We draw implications for clinical practice and future research\
  \ involving pets, children, and childhood family trauma."
