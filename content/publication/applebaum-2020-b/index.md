abstract: "Pets may be a positive presence for their owners during the Coronavirus\
  \ Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is pertinent to identify the hardships\
  \ associated with pet ownership. We conducted a large-scale survey of U.S. pet owners\
  \ (n = 2254) in spring and summer 2020 to assess the ways that relationships with\
  \ pets impacted life during COVID-19. We used thematic analysis to analyze 3671\
  \ open-ended responses to three prompts. Reported concerns fell into three major\
  \ categories: (1) pet-focused (meeting needs of pets; procuring supplies; accessing\
  \ veterinary care; new and emerging behavioral issues; fate of the pet if owner\
  \ becomes ill; general safety and well-being), (2) human-focused (issues with working\
  \ from home; well-being and mental health; balancing responsibilities), and (3)\
  \ household-focused (disease spread; economic issues). Quantitative analyses showed\
  \ that the owner's strength of attachment to their pet, economic resources, and\
  \ relationship status were associated with the types of concerns expressed. Results\
  \ from this study indicate that pet owners experienced unique hardships related\
  \ to changes in everyday life from the COVID-19 pandemic. These hardships should\
  \ be considered alongside the potential benefits found in other studies in order\
  \ to manage pet owner expectations, prevent pet relinquishment, and more fully understand\
  \ multifaceted human-companion animal relationships."
