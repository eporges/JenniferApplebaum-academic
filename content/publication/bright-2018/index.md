abstract: Youth who engage in animal cruelty are known to be at increased risk of
  perpetrating violence on other people in their lives including peers, loved ones,
  and elder family members. These youths have often been exposed to family violence,
  including animal cruelty perpetrated on their beloved pets by violent adults. The
  current study utilizes a data set of 81,000 juvenile offenders whose adverse childhood
  experiences are known and includes 466 youth who self-report engaging in animal
  cruelty. Compared to the larger group of juvenile offenders, the children admitting
  to engaging in animal cruelty are younger at time of first arrest, more likely to
  be male, and more likely to be White. When looking at their reports of adverse childhood
  experiences (ACEs), they are more likely than other juvenile offenders to have an
  array of adverse experiences beyond family violence and to have four or more ACEs.
  Although the youth who are cruel to animals are already troubled, the fact that
  they present to law enforcement at early ages provides early opportunities for intervention.
  Service providers outside the law enforcement field, such as teachers, physicians,
  veterinarians and animal control officers may be able to identify these vulnerable
  youth, and refer them to needed services before violence is visited on other humans.
