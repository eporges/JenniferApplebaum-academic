abstract: Pets are an important aspect of many families and households, but how many
  Americans have them? The purpose of this study is to compare point estimates of
  pet ownership in the U.S. from the General Social Survey (GSS) to estimates from
  other surveys, and to report demographic and social correlates to pet ownership.
  Wide discrepancies in estimates of U.S. pet ownership have been previously reported,
  relying on private industry surveys that do not disclose sampling design. Further,
  some surveys that reported pet ownership were not available for public use and/or
  did not lend themselves to social science due to a limited number of other measures
  of important social and demographic characteristics. U.S. estimates of pet ownership
  from the GSS tended to be slightly higher than those based on the American Veterinary
  Medical Association Pet Ownership and Demographics Sourcebook and consistently lower
  than estimates based on the American Pet Products Association National Pet Owners
  Survey. Pet ownership varied by race/ethnicity, age, size of place, household composition,
  and dwelling type. Number and type of pets also varied considerably by social and
  demographic characteristics. We conclude that the 2018 GSS has several advantages
  for studying humanâ€“animal interaction including a nationally representative sample,
  availability of a wide range of covariates, and public accessibility.
