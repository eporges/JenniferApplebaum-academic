abstract: 'This qualitative study identified a study area by visualizing one year
  of animal intake from a municipal animal shelter on geographic information systems
  (GIS) maps to select an area of high stray-dog intake to investigate. Researchers
  conducted semi-structured interviews with residents of the selected study area to
  elucidate why there were high numbers of stray dogs coming from this location. Using
  grounded theory, three themes emerged from the interviews: concerns, attitudes,
  and disparities. The residents expressed concerns about animal welfare, personal
  safety, money, and health. They held various attitudes toward domestic animals in
  the community, including viewing them as pets, pests, or useful commodities (products).
  Residents expressed acceptance as well as some anger and fear about the situation
  in their community. Interviewees revealed they faced multiple socioeconomic disparities
  related to poverty. Pet abandonment can result when pet owners must prioritize human
  needs over animal needs, leading to increased shelter intake of stray dogs. Community-specific
  strategies for reducing local animal shelter intake should address the issue of
  pet abandonment by simultaneously targeting veterinary needs of animals, socioeconomic
  needs of residents, and respecting attitude differences between residents and shelter
  professionals.'
